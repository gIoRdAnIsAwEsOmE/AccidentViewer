Plans.

Pop the Maps:

Why I am doing this: Parents are planning to visit some country

How it works:
 - Showcase a map [x]
 - Have it drop pins to show which areas to visit. []
 - When you get close to a pin it will tell you that you've been to that place. []
 - Showcase the food specialities/restaurants in the area. []
 - Make it able to switch choices []
 - Able to search through places (regular houses, landmarks, any) []
  CORE!!!!!!!
  If anything is possible I can do more, then I'll do it.
